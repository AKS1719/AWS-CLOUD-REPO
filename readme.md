## `What is AWS ?`

#### `Amazon web services`

##### Amazon web services is a subsidiary of Amazon.com that provides on demand cloud computing platforms to individuals, companies and governments, on a paid subscription basis with a free-tier option available for 12 months.

## `What is Cloud ?`

##### "The cloud" refers to servers that are accessed over the Internet, and the software and databases that run on those servers. Cloud servers are located in data centers all over the world. By using cloud computing, users and companies do not have to manage physical servers themselves or run software applications on their own machines.


## `What is Cloud Computing ?`

##### Simply put, cloud computing is the delivery of computing services-including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence-over the Internet ("the cloud") to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. You typically pay only for cloud services you use, helping lower your operating costs, run your infrastructure more efficiently and scale as your business needs change.

### Infrastructure as a service

#### IaaS, or Infrastructure as a Service, is a cloud computing model that provides on-demand access to computing resources such as servers, storage, networking, and virtualization.
#### Here we have to own the databases and servers 

## `What is Faas (Server less computing) ?`

#### Function as a service (FaaS) is a cloud-computing service that allows customers to run code in response to events, without managing the complex infrastructure typically associated with building and launching microservices applications.

## `Why use AWS `

#### We have developed a App or website for deployment purpose we have to deploy them somewhere on servers for that i need to buy servers now to 

#### If number of users is large then there are chances of getting the servers collapsed to avoid that we can buy more servers 

#### But if the traffic is too high for our plaftorm then those servers will be overburdened 

#### Solution for this is hire IT services worker to manage the servers 

#### This are so much expensive 

#### We can use cloud as AWS offers the servers and the maintainance of the servers and charges them of what they are using it
